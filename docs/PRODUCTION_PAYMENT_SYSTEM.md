# Payment System - Production Ready Implementation

## Summary of Changes Made

### 🔧 **Removed Test/Simulation Code**

1. **Deleted SimulatePayments Command**
   - Removed `app/Console/Commands/SimulatePayments.php`
   - This command was only for testing and not suitable for production

2. **Fixed Webhook Handler for Real Payments**
   - Enhanced webhook security with proper signature verification
   - Removed test environment bypasses
   - Improved logging for production monitoring

### 🚀 **New Production Commands**

1. **CheckPendingPayments Command**
   ```bash
   php artisan payments:check-pending --hours=2 --auto-expire
   ```
   - Monitor payments pending longer than specified hours
   - Auto-expire abandoned payments
   - Check orphaned StudentBills without payments

2. **MonitorRevenue Command**
   ```bash
   php artisan revenue:monitor --clear-cache --export=json
   ```
   - Real-time revenue monitoring
   - Detailed payment statistics by type
   - Export capabilities (CSV/JSON)

### 💰 **Revenue System Improvements**

1. **Fixed Duplication Issues**
   - Registration revenue only from Payment table
   - Bills/SPP revenue only from BillPayment table
   - Uang Pangkal properly tracked via StudentBill

2. **Enhanced Statistics**
   - Separate tracking by payment type
   - Status breakdown (PAID/PENDING/EXPIRED)
   - Amount breakdown by bill type

### 🛡️ **Production Security Enhancements**

1. **Payment Method Mapping**
   - Added proper mapping from Xendit to BillPayment enum values
   - QR_CODE → e_wallet, BANK_TRANSFER → bank_transfer, etc.

2. **Webhook Verification**
   - Always verify webhook signature regardless of environment
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Security headers validation

- **Uang Pangkal**: Rp 3.500.000 (1 paid, 3 pending)
- **Total Revenue**: Rp 15.866.250

### 🎯 **Key Production Features**

1. **Real Payment Flow**
   - User creates payment → Xendit invoice created → User pays → Webhook updates status → StudentBill updated
   - No simulation or test shortcuts

2. **Proper Error Handling**
   - Invalid cart data validation
   - Payment method constraint validation
   - External ID uniqueness checks

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Commands for checking stale payments
   - Revenue export for financial reporting
   - Detailed logging for debugging

   ```

3. **Check payment logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "payment\|webhook"
   ```

The system is now production-ready with proper real payment processing, no test shortcuts, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
